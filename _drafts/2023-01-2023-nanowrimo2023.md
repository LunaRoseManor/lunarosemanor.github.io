# Introduction
I'd been writing the same novel on and off for over three years. It got to the
point that, whenever I was sat idle on a train or the sofa I'd stop and think:

"I truly wish I'd hurry up and finish already."

The idea that this doesn't exist pains me and doesn't leave a lot of room for
interpretation.

I've been writing the same novel for over three years. It's gotten to the point 
where when I'm on a train or sat at home without anything else to do, I'll think:

"I really wish I'd finish that novel already."

And it's not just because it's the only novel idea I have. I have several
floating around inside my skull at any given time. It's just that this particular work
had too much I liked about it to leave it alone forever. Its strange how the 
application of an idea plus time can leave you with this hollow, empty feeling 
that you should have done it, you could have done it had you been a stronger 
person.

But how on Earth am I ever going to motivate myself to push out a first draft when so many other attempts I've had failed? How do I know this won't drag on another three years and I'll feel even more regret than if I simply committed to working on other projects? Will I be doomed to become one of *those* writers for the rest of my life?

Since I am of a nervous disposition I often find myself thinking questions like this about my writing all the time. And all of this is further exacerbated by the fact that, because this is my first novel and there's no guarantee of a second, that this will be the only novel I ever write. And that has lead to a lot of weird decisions and thinking about my creative process that is deeply unhelpful.

Thankfully, there's a clean and elegant solution to all of this.

# The National Novel Writing Month
I hate dictionary introductions to concepts in non-fiction writing. If you can't use a search engine, why are you even attempting to engage with the subject matter in a critical manner in the first place? Despite this, I still have people come up to me and tell me they have absolutely no idea what on Earth I'm talking about, so here goes.

The National Novel Writing Month (which I'll refer to as "NaNoWriMo") is an annual challenge organised by charity in which you must write 50,000 words of a new novel in 30 days. It's been going ever since 1999 and has been the genesis of many a new novel over the years. I've actually taken part in it a number of times myself after I was introduced to it very closely to the event happening in 2020. Just for the sake of posterity I'll write about how each of those years went quickly so when I need to explain them again, I can just link to this post instead of having to repeat myself.

## 2020
At this point, I was very much a "some day" writer. One of those authors who wants to write a book some day without any serious intention to release it or have it scrutinised by living people. I read books. I had even entered a couple of short fiction competitions and won. But for whatever reason me and writing just never really came together. When I heard of the challenge it almost seemed too simplistic. There was no way you could ever finish a novel this way. It simply wasn't possible. That didn't stop me from trying.

I had about a week or so to prepare. I spent about none of that time seriously giving it my best shot. I briefly had an idea to write a book about a man going to great lengths to participate in the competition before being sent on the run after something strange and mysterious happens. But this got shelved very quickly when I had what I believed to be a golden egg of an idea:

*Lesbian Amazonian Catgirls*

Thankfully, this didn't go anywhere. Turns out this whole writing thing was much, much harder than I first thought. I managed to write about a single scene that I liked and the rest of it was stream of consciousness garbage trying to fill up word count. A lot of it writing whatever I happened to think was funny that day which was almost certainly not funny at all. A lot of scenes that went nowhere with no underlying plot structure and prose that looked like a chimpanzee ordered a fly to write it. 

There was some stuff I liked. There was a particular scene where a character was being berated by their mother that had a strange amount of emotional bite to it. Though since it didn't connect to the loose connection of pocket fluff that I would call a plot structure it would almost certainly have to be cut anyway. The problem was since I was surrounded by much more competant writers and I felt a childish need to show off to everyone how brilliant I was. It wasn't an entire waste of time! I did find the research process engaging and it did prove to me that novel writing was possible, even if it was about as difficult as I expected.

## 2021
I'm going to mostly be skipping over this year because of how it intersects with this one. Needless to say I felt that I should be taking someone else's advice for once and creating a short story collection or an anthology in an attempt to give myself the opportunity to work on other things. This didn't pan out and I ended up having to skip this year entirely.

## 2022
This was going to be the year that I would complete the challenge as intended. I started my planning early. I was going to do it right. Ultimately it didn't work out as planned. I had to change the entire concept of the novel halfway through. At first it was kind of a depressing, nautical themed horror that I feel would be much better for a video game than a book. The other idea I had was to write a magical girl murder mystery. This also ended up being seriously depressing and I bailed on it after 20,000 words. Real life seriously got in the way and I'd love to return to this concept as well.

## 2023
This by far and away has to be my most successful attempt so far. An almost complete manuscript, this is  This is principally what this article is about, so I won't spend too much time on it. All you need to know is that I got a severe case of wrist cramp.

# Background
## It began with a sketch...

[Insert scan of the one drawing here]

This one drawing is to blame for hundreds of hours being poured into a creative project I believed in. It ended up being entirely different to how I expected. It wasn't intended to be a novel for starters. I had just got done watching the Castlevania TV show and wanted something that had a distinctly visual flair. I figured a comic book was something I could finish this decade. I was sincerely wrong about that. Keep an eye on my reference game because it comes back to haunt me later in life.

The working title was initially "Catwitch". Like "sandwich", just with a distinctly feline flavour. It's a simple premise really, a witch and her cat have traded places and now they have to travel the land to put each other back in their original forms. To be honest, I don't know why I went with this. I could have done it, I probably should have. But over my head I felt this pressure to create something grand and brilliant. Something that I'd be happy leaving as a legacy. Whilst we're at it, make sure to keep an eye on my pretention and ego. Yet another ghost we can add to the list.

One day, perhaps after finishing a very angry read of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time, I was struck by a profound thought. There aren't any autistic superheroes that I can name. I was sure they existed, but didn't have a capital "S" Story that came along with them. I thought of all the monsters and demons of the night. I thought of a character that could take them on and win. I thought of Dahlia.

## Dahlia
I think the strongest indicator of just how much development it took to whip my NaNoWriMo entry into something workable is to pay close attention to how this character develops along with their story. At first I was catching up on Samurai Jack and really wanted to lean into the "lone wanderer" archetype. A doctor, someone who would hop about from place to place in a gothic rendition of Victorian England. At this early stage the best kind of plot I figured was as little plot as possible. She couldn't spend all of her time alone so we'll add a little ghost girl for extra grim comedy. All of a sudden this didn't sound like something I'd actually want to write.

Luckily, someone suggested that in order to travel so much on a working class budget, they'd need to work for the railways. I changed their direction from there. Despite this, I really have a long way to go in developing her into someone likable. Her sole devotion to patricide is interesting, but doesn't provide much depth. I'm skipping ahead a little here so bear with me.

You see, in the earliest drafts Dahlia was perhaps a little too competant. Obnoxiously unflappable, if you will. Also, having her cart around a ghost like a fashion accessory just made it all too obvious that I had been binge reading Erma at around the same time. Also, wouldn't people ask questions about a cross-dressing cat person walking around with a magic broomstick? Note how the witch aspect of her character was retained for a long time. I can't imagine everyone she meets being entirely friendly. The idea of her feline appearance being an allegory for the autistic experience was integral from the very beginning. But it was much later I got another idea. An awful, terrible idea.

## The Mask
It was around the time that the story starts to capture my interest. I had themes floating around in my head, but it was the exact moment that I held the image of a cursed mask inside of my mind where they solidified. I was aware of other stories that featured similar objects. It's a common motif in horror and indeed comics. But I think moreso than other works the exact mechanics of the Mask of Pride gave me the direction I needed to know what I was working on. Magic is a potent element to add to any story. I'm still figuring out the particulars of how it works in mine, but overall I think having a distinct object to write about made the developmental editing a lot easier.

To begin with, Dahlia would be able to remove it while constantly taunting her and into putting it back on. Though I lament the absence of this aspect of the story, I feel I made the concept a lot more understandable once I took that ability away. This stopped the plot from boiling down to a handful of people arguing over the same lump of metal. It speaks much more to the intended themes of the work, too. Speaking only for myself, my own mask is permenantly grafted to my face. I don't know if it will ever leave me. I wanted this to be a metaphor that works both inside and outside of the fiction.

In short, the mask became its own character and my story is all the more improved for it. One that is trying to protect Dahlia, but constantly drains her strength against her will. It has its own goal to achieve that drives further conflict. It makes her tragic desire to kill somewhat understandable as I describe the itching, burning sensation on her skin. The only way to scratch it being to kill her father, or so she thinks.

## Villains and Genre
I'm not really the biggest fan of villains in fiction. As much use as they aid the writer in giving the story a focus, there's a lot to do with promoting binary morality that can be genuinely harmful. People don't generally think of themselves as evil. We've seen this play out time and time again throughout our history. It was once I decided that the more typical villain named Elric was Dahlia's father that I sprang out of my bed and began to write what would turn into the version I'd submit to the event.

Henry is a great husband, but a terrible father. He supports Dahlia and her unusual appearance only so far as it doesn't interfere with his wife. By the time the story starts, she's long dead. It took me an embarassingly long time to realise this. You see, Gothic fiction has a lot of blood. Not in the literal sense like with slasher movies, but metaphorically. Giving him that familial connection really shored up the concept and stopped it floating away into other genres.

Still to this day I worry that the book isn't scary enough. Action has been core to my work since the very beginning and I'm sure there's some way to do it in future drafts that isn't distracting. But people have been dressing up as vampires for Halloween for decades now. It's hard to make that relevant to audiences born centuries after the revival. But when I noticed that Henry's actions in the story directly conflict with the express wishes of his daughter that he became frightening to me. He wants to help, he thinks he knows how, but his perceptions have been warped by his grief that he is completely unable to. This directly lead into the writing of Lucy's character, which

Panther (I'm still thinking of a formal title for it) was always intended to be a horror story. Specifically Gothic Revival fiction, with Dracula being the closest comparison. I've read a lot of that stuff as part of pre-production, but it took me years to actually sit and read the TVTropes article on the subject. The wasted time chasing conspiracy thrillers, great detective fiction and others without giving my own story its own identity is what caused those three years to sail by. Even still, I must note that what I'm intending to write is much closer to Shakespearean Tragedy than Gothic Horror. Which makes sense given that it's the direct ancestor. Watching Macbeth really cleared my head and made me understand that the Gothic can be a theme rather than a distinct genre you apply to your work. Now, that's enough of my rambling about a book I haven't finished. What happened when I finally tried to write it?

# The Main Event
## Planning
Throughout the years I've learned the hard way that I can't write spontaneously. I've tried many times and I just can't quite manage it. Luckily for me, prior to nano I've been working on this story for as long as my writing group had known me. It was a fortunate example of being in the right place at the right time. I don't recommend you wait to participate in crazy internet challenges like this. Having said that, I did spend a little bit too much time monkeying with character names instead of doing long-neglected research on late 19th century England and its railways. I also ended up throwing out my Freytag's pyramid about halfway through.

## Writing
My computer was locked down with an improperly configured parental control on
the first day of the event. Not off to an especially great start. In lieu of
having a keyboard to hand, I took up a pen. And I continued to write with a pen
throughout the entire event. In hindsight, this was a herculean effort that I
greatly underestimated. Because of this stubbonness, I almost managed to throw
the event. I didn't make a single word target past day four or so. In line with
its reputation NaNoWriMo was brutal. I was lucky that I had a concept I believed
in and had lots of ideas for interesting scenes. If I hadn't, I almost certainly
would have given up. In the end, I had to abandon the pen in the last 12 hours
and copy and paste the word "spam" over and over again in order to make word
count. Needless to say I'll think twice about working this way in the future.

## The Controversy
I don't like bringing up interpersonal conflict unecessarily, especially when it
involves sensitive matters such as these, but I can't just omit it entirely.
A moderator of the official forums had extremely lax boundaries between themselves
and children, to put it lightly. I'll be honest, I was mostly asleep while this
was happening. I only found out through my local chapter and don't use the
forums much at all. I can only hope that those affected are now safe. I feel the
need to state that this won't affect my attendance, as much as I probably should
reconsider my participation and monetary support in the future. Even if I'm not
using Nano's computer systems or organising I still find it too useful as a tool
to give up entirely. Perhaps I'll do it in October next year to pre-empt any
future mistakes.

## The Aftermath
I won, but just barely. It doesn't feel like a worthy victory, but I have a
manuscript finished that exists almost entirely in narrative prose with no
stream of consciousness or hacks. I will be editing it in the new year and
hopefully have something to release partway through 2024. We'll see how that
pans out as I really want to adhere to a yearly schedule with my novel writing
going forward. I don't want it to be this one project any more. I want to
become a novelist.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is me going over the thing that I did this month. I feel that when I start drafting I need to spend some time and just get into the mood. I feel that it might take some timee and I may make soem false starts. When I'm writing stream of consciousness like this, I discover that kats are cute. No, I mean that I tend to repeat myself a lot. I should probably start by outlining the sections that I want:

- What I did
- Background
- What I learned
- What went wrong


All the basic things that a novel of this type is intended to have. As much space as I have I probably should do some research on how these kinds of things work, specifically retrospectives and postmortem reports.

# Introduction

I have been working on a novel for the past three years. I've been working on several, actually. I think that it was about time and went and finished it. But this presents a problem. How do I create an entire novel in a short amount of time without it becoming a large amount of effort and dragging on for a further three years?

# Chris Baty
The national novel writing months is a writing challenge started in 1999 by Chris Baty. The goal is simple. Starting on November the first and ending on November the Thirtieth, you must write 50,000 words of a new novel. No exceptions.

# How I went about this.
I've actually done this challenge a number of times. The first time I attempted this challenge, I was working on a novel about a tribe of catgirl amazons. There was a giant tiki mech battle at the end. Let it never see the light of day. The second time was a little more organised. I wanted to write a short story collection but ultimately never ended up taking part. I also had two more attempts, one being a horror novel that I'd want to adapt into a traditional survival horror game and the other would be a magical girl murder mystery that I very much intend on finishing.

So I already have some experience. I know how gruelling this challenge can be. What I have learned from doing this before is that I am not someone who is able to be spontaneous. If I'm writing a story that has any kind of plot or characters to it, I can't just go and figure out the story. I need to know where things were going.

Fortunately, this book has already been through three years of preproduction hell. In other words it was almost like free labour where I didn't have to do much to figure out what was going to happen to the story during the month. Most of the work here was just going over my notes and figuring out what this story was about and how I would build it.

There was a lot to go over. I tend to plan stories through hand writing and they tend to change a lot before they actually go to be read by someone else. Usually when I have the idea, I have the entirely wrong idea. If you have your entire idea or. Sorry. If you are a writer yourself, I'd take the lesson away from this that no piece of writing comes out fully formed.

On top of this, upon going over my notes it was imminently clear that I had a lot of growing to do. Some parts of the novel seem reflective of beliefs that I held at the time but no longer do. Or otherwise I still have those ideas wedged deep into my head but I'm starting to do the due diligence to get rid of them.

A lot of my new planning came in the form of fixing up timelines and giving the characters new names. These tasks weren't probably the best use of my time given the fact that the action sections weren't planned until days before the event.

So without further ado, I'd like to share some things that I have learned over the course of doing this challenge and others like it.

# Lessons Learned
## Write By Hand
If you're not physically able to write by hand, you can sit this one out, but what I've found is that I write worse when I have a keyboard in my hands. I will never claim that writing by hand is very transmissible or practical. The speed of writing by hand can be excruciating. I write about 67 words per miute on an actual keyboard and it turns out that I only write about 220 words every 40 minutes when writing by hand.

Those kinds of numbers are not the ones you want to see if your goal is to release a lot of fiction before your inevitable demise.

What it does do however, is force you to slow down. There's a clear difference between those two things. When you're forced to write at handwriting speeds, it changes your mindset to make each word count. I've come across at least one other writer who feels the same way, so two people can't be as wrong as one, right?

I find myself choosing my words more carefully when writing by hand. Typing them up can be pretty thoughtless and I personally find it motivating to see the number of physical pages lying around my desk. However, for this challenge I feel it might have been a mistake.

You see, when you're writing by hand, you have no idea how many words you've written. you only have the words that you feel took a lot of effort to write. This is a big difference. For me, I needed at least 40 pages completed before I realised that I could fit an average of 220 pages handwritten on sheets of lined A4 paper. So that's 220 per side.

This lead to me being dangerously behind. I started to lag almost immediately because I grossly underestimated how much effort that would take. I'm not sure I would do it again, but in general I much prefer not looking at a screen when it comes to my first draft. I feel like I will get better results for this blog by using the keyboard but only because of the format.

## Plan ahead
I feel like I already mentioned this one? If you have a plan you won't have to come up with a new story entirely from scratch. This can box you in, so I prefer to be a little looser with my planning and work on scenes spontaneously while also knowing where I'm going.

## Write out of order
By now you might have gotten the idea that all I'm saying is very basic advice. thts because I'm a very basic writer. I've only been doing this seriously for less than four years, about the length of your average university course. Not that I'd ever compare myself to a university major in this field of course.

# The Novel
So I feel I should also talk about the specific challenges and discoveries I had with the novel itself, but I feel that it might spoil too much of the plot? I also feel some of the other things with how the book deals with race and gender aren't things I'm willing to discuss as of the time that it isn't out yet.

So it's a gothic horror novel right? Wrong!

In planning this novel, I realised that there is a massive problem with genre. You see, I had planned this as a gothic horror after bouncing between fantasy, mystery and conspiracy thriller. But when I looked at this hollistically I realised that what I was actually writing was a form of shakespearian tragedy. Which makes sense.

# The Controversy
I was kind of half asleep when it happened. I didn't hear about the events until way after they had transpired. I really don't like discussing things of this nature and would encourage anyone expecting me to talk about it to do their own research. I don't use the Nanowrimo forums and use a private discord server that had nothing to do with the controversy.

I really don't know how to feel about it honestly. My main concern is that ayone who was hurt was able to get help and it seems like the response by Nanowrimo themselves has been mature and trying to get to a point where somelthing like this never happens again.

# Conclusion
I just want to get to the end of this blog post so I can get along to the next drafts. I look forward to seeing you again next year.
