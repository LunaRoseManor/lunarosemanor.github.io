If you're reading this, you've somehow stumbled upon my first ever blog post.
The quality around this time might not be reflective of later articles. I aim
to write about code, art, and whatever else happens to commendeer my brain at
any given time. Once in a blue moon to start with, then more rapidly as I
figured out a workable schedule.
