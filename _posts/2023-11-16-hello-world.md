This default post is here to let you know you installed Jekyll and String Theory
correctly. You'll find it in the `_posts` directory. If you have any issues or
suggestions, be sure to check the project out the
[GitHub](https://github.com/LunaRoseManor/jekyll-string-theory).
String Theory is designed to be small and fast, so I'll leave you be.
