title: I Remembered the Password
---

Somehow I blinked and two years passed. It's genuinely frightening to me how little I am able to percieve time. I haven't been totally idle though. I have written several articles for the site that simply never got uploaded. I can't guarantee they're any good and I forgot when exactly I wrote them, but I feel it's about time they were published somewhere online. Expect more activity from this blog at some point, just not at all regularly.
