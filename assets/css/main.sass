// The main sass file, which collates all of the different sass mixins into a
// single file to be built. Jekyll should copy this file to `/assets/main.css`
// which means that no other file can share that name in this folder. Ideally,
// this file should be the only one that relates to site styles. CSS libraries
// should be included in the `_config.yml` file in the root folder. Ideally,
// this sass file should be in a separate "styles" folder inside the "assets"
// folder, but that mean the default minima styles don't get overwritten
// when this gets run on GitHub Pages and the compatibility is needed.
