## The Author
Emily Ahlquist is a British artist. She's been writing for as long as she can remember and doesn't quite know how to stop. She lives in her home in the East Midlands with her cat.

## The Name
Obtained by stuffing a bunch of stereotypically "gothic" words into a Python script and filtering the results. It's meant to be a parody of ["Scarlet Devil Mansion"](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Scarlet_Devil_Mansion), the space-bending house from [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project). There's probably some inspiration from the book [House of Leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Leaves) in there too.

## The Site
Written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and a little bit of Sass, it's built into regular HTML and CSS files with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.org/) and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). It's open source and you can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/LunaRoseManor/lunarosemanor.github.io), where it's hosted free of charge thanks to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
