## The Author
Emily "Luna" Ahlquist is a wannabe web developer from the UK. She first started
writing websites in high school and now doesn't quite know how to stop. She
lives at her home in Nottinghamshire with her cat.

## The Name
Obtained by stuffing a bunch of stereotypically gothic words into a python
script and hoping for the best. It's meant to be a parody of "Scarlet Devil
Mansion", the mythical house from Touhou Project.
