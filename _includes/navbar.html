    I've been working on this for four hours so I'll keep it simple.

    Adding in a nav element to the header introduces a tricky problem. How
    do you make it respond to the user's file structure without them having
    to code anything? How do you stop it throwing a tantrum?

    Jekyll doesn't really have anything built in to do this. You get a
    small handful of local variables. Liquid also doesn't have regular
    expressions, making searching through results impossible.

    Instead of that, String Theory just tries to mimic Minima's default
    behaviour and search through the asset tree to find pages that have
    titles. If a page hasn't been titled, it's probably not important.

    Otherwise, the user can set which pages are navigable through data, as
    recommended by the official Jekyll tutorial:

{%- assign default_paths = site.pages | map: "path" -%}
{%- assign page_paths = site.header_pages | default: default_paths -%}
{%- assign titles_size = site.pages | map: "title" | join: "" | size -%}
{%- if titles_size > 0 -%}
    <nav class="site-nav">
        {%- for path in page_paths -%}
            {%- assign my_page = site.pages | where: "path", path | first -%}
            
            {%- if my_page.title -%}
                <a href="{{ my_page.url | relative_url }}">{{ my_page.title | escape }}</a>
            {%- endif -%}
        {% endfor %}
    </nav>
{%- endif -%}
